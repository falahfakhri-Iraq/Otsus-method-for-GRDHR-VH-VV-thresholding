# Otsus-method-for-GRDHR-VH-VV-thresholding
Calculate the VH, VV threshold of GRDHR VH, and VV
This model has been extracted and edited from the following two resources,
 
https://muthu.co/otsus-method-for-image-thresholding-explained-and-implemented/

https://scikit-image.org/docs/0.12.x/auto_examples/segmentation/plot_local_otsu.html

In order to calculate the VH, and VV threshold of Interferometric Wide Swath IW, Ground Range Detected High Resolution (HR) GRDHR,

But a preperation to an image is needed beforehand, 

running this model, the preperation is mentioned within this repository as well under the name, 

Intensity_GRD.xml, it's possible to run this *.xml file suing SNAP, or using gpt luncher in the

other repository within my github in the following link,
